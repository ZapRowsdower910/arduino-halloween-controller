# arduino-halloween-controller

Controller box for halloween project. The controller uses a PIR sensor and an ultrasonic sensor to detect motion and proximity. IR signals are sent out to control LED torches using NEC controller codes. The torch has 3 states, low burn, gutteral, and high burn. The closer the proximity to the controller the higher the torch burns.
